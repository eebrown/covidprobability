# R package: covidprobability

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package provides the functions, data and documentation that support a 
calculator to determine the probability of an undetected COVID-19 infection in
a setting/unit after a potential exposure, testing, and when there are no 
symptomatic cases. For a detailed explanation of the rationale and 
implementation, please see the vignette.


## Installation

Warning this package is still in development.

You can install the latest version of covidprobability from [Github](https://github.com/eebrown/covidprobability) with:

``` r
devtools::install.github("eebrown/covidprobability")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(covidprobability)

test_n <- unit_probability(test_day = 9, pre0 =  0.13, sens = sens, spec = 1, 
                           incubation = incubation, asympt = 0.278, n = 10)

```


```{r unit_example, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:14, test_n$point, type="l", ylim=c(0,1),
     main = "Unit-wide probabiltiy of undetected COVID-19",
     xlab = "Days since exposures",
     ylab = "Probability")
lines(test_n$lower, type="l", col="grey")
lines(test_n$upper, type="l", col="grey")
```
